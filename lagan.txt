According to Pluralsight CEO Aaron Skonnard, Code School’s focus on new developers was part of the reason why it was interested in the property.

Much of the content in the new app is free, while those who subscribe to Code School’s premium product will be able to unlock all videos. The app, however, is meant to complement but not replace Code School’s online educational resource, which is where developers learn hands-on by coding in the browser while watching screencasts and other course videos.

A Community First, A Business Second

The idea for Code School came about through Pollack’s own interest in creating educational content for developers, which he began doing around eight years ago. His focus at the time was the then still relatively new framework, Ruby on Rails. “As with any new technology in its infancy, the documentation sucked,” Pollack explains. “So I would blog about it. I got into podcasting; I would go and speak at conferences about it; I would create videos about it…it was just something I would do in my spare time,” he says.

For his day job, Pollack consulted, eventually rebranding his consultancy to “Envy Labs” around five years ago. All the educational material he was publishing was attracting clients, but he wasn’t trying to turn that content into a money-making business of its own at that point, he says.
---
But in November 2010, Pollack released what soon became a popular course, “Rails for Zombies,” where he combined video content with coding in the browser for the first time. This was long before other online “learn to code” startups even existed — for instance, competitor Codecademy wasn’t founded until the following year
---
By March 2011, that business idea became Code School, launching with just one free Rails course and one paid. Today, the site has grown to include over 40 courses across a variety of topics and designed for a wide range of developers, from the newcomers looking to learn coding for the first time, to more advanced developers looking to refine or expand their skills

---
Now the company is working to reach an audience who is interested in learning while on the go with its new app. Though, obviously, the app doesn’t include the ability to code alongside the videos, it can serve as a way to reinforce what you previously learned while practicing on the web, familiarize yourself with new topics, or just brush up on rusty skills.
